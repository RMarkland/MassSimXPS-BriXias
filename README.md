# MassSimXPS-BriXias
A series of modifications to the BriXias Simulation code allowing mass XPS sim for Bi-Layer Systems.

To enact changes, drop .ipf files in your IgorPro BriXias folder and replace duplicates.
This shouldn't change the way the base simulator works, only adds an additional panel for mass XPS simulation of binary systems.
